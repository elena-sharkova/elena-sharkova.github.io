          <p class="blog-text reflection-prompt">Long term goals</p>
          <p class="blog-text">I hope to work on something meaningful and practical and not just consumerism-focused. Ideally, it's a start-up in Christchurch! üòä</p>
          <p class="blog-text reflection-prompt">Strengths and limitations</p>
          <p class="blog-text">One of my limitations I've re-discovered during Foundations is that I struggle to ask for help because it feels like cheating. If I can't Google my way out of it or find relevant discussions on Discord, I could spend hours trying to solve a problem by myself. It does feel more rewarding in the end and I tend to remember the issue better, but I don't think it's going to be viable during Bootcamp. </p>
          <p class="blog-text reflection-prompt">Non-technical challenges</p>
          <p class="blog-text">I think of one of the biggest non-technical challenge during Bootcamp is going to be routine and working on my own after I'm done for the day. I fear it is going to be so draining that I would want to switch off, but I will have to push through and study in the evenings as well. 
            The other massive challenge is definitely going to be pair programming. I am very introverted by nature and I need to recharge after long conversations. I am absolutely horrified that I will have to spend all day on video/audio calls and have little to no downtime at all. It's also pretty scary in terms of producing working code because how am I going to think while talking to my pair? 
             </p>
          <p class="blog-text reflection-prompt">Humans skills to work on</p>
          <p class="blog-text">I would like to work on my collaboration and communication skills, especially in group settings. I don't want to be too quiet during discussions nor silence the ideas of others. I believe that working in pairs even leading to our very first group assignment is going to help immensely.¬†</p>
          <p class="blog-text reflection-prompt">Expectations from the Bootcamp team</p>
          <p class="blog-text">I hope to get more detailed technical feedback from the Bootcamp team than during Foundations, hopefully with some code reviews. I expect the team to guide us through at least the first pair programming and team assignments. A good way of showing support would be acknowledging that we are doing something really difficult and emotionally (and even somewhat physically) demanding. </p>
          <p class="blog-text reflection-prompt">Expectations from myself</p>
          <p class="blog-text">If I'm struggling emotionally, I will reach out to my loved ones, my peers or the Human Skills team depending on the issue. For technical problems, I plan to ask my peers/tutors more questions if things don't quite click.
            In terms of managing my workload, I hope I'll be able to stick to my timetable/planner and avoid working late into the night. I should really keep using the Toggl because Pomodoro timers provide me with external motivation. I can be very irritable if I miss out on sleep, and my peers and tutors don't deserve to experience that. üòä My mental health is going to be extra important during Bootcamp, so I will focus on techniques that help me bring my stress levels down. </p>

            What is your long term goal or career pathway?
          </p>
          <p class="blog-text">
            I would love to change careers and become confident enough to apply
            for junior/internship positions in New Zealand or remotely.
          </p>

            A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
            learning
          </p>
          <p class="blog-text">
            My biggest strengths are probably my curiosity and a desire to get my
            hands dirty, so to speak. I struggle with big chunks of theoretical
            information without any practice. My limitations are connected to a
            trait I actually like about myself, my pace. I like to work quickly, I
            try and research topics as fast as I can, but my impatience is often
            my downfall. Some things you just can't rush.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-text reflection-prompt">
            What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
            developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
          </p>
          <p class="blog-text">
            Attending Dev Academy won't change my extremely introverted nature,
            but I hope this experience helps me learn how to collaborate and be
            more approachable.

            An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
            and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
            representatives
          </p>
          <p class="blog-text">
            Knowing my tendency to procrastinate until the very last possible
            moment, I am creating some mini goals for myself throughout the
            Sprints. I am trying to follow the timetable I've developed for
            myself, because once you get into a routine, things get so much easier
            and less stressful.
          </p>

            What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
            you
          </p>
          <p class="blog-text">
            If I'm starting to struggle with the mental load and my support system
            is not enough, I'll reach out to my facilitators or vent to a fellow
            student who I've made a connection with.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-text reflection-prompt">
            A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
          </p>
          <p class="blog-text">
            I expect the Facilitation team to have my back if I'm struggling both
            emotionally and academically. The bootcamp is going to be insanely
            difficult, so I really need all the help I can get.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-text reflection-prompt">
            Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
            committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
            commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-text">
            As of now, I'm very fortunate to be able to fully devote my time to
            studying. I will still try and schedule an occasional date night with my husband while he's supporting me on this
            journey.
