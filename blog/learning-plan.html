          What is your long term goal or career pathway?
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          I would love to change careers and become confident enough to apply
          for junior/internship positions in New Zealand or remotely.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text reflection-prompt">
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          My biggest strengths are probably my curiosity and a desire to get my
          hands dirty, so to speak. I struggle with big chunks of theoretical
          information without any practice. My limitations are connected to a
          trait I actually like about myself, my pace. I like to work quickly, I
          try and research topics as fast as I can, but my impatience is often
          my downfall. Some things you just can't rush.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text reflection-prompt">
          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Attending Dev Academy won't change my extremely introverted nature,
          but I hope this experience helps me learn how to collaborate and be
          more approachable.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text reflection-prompt">
          An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
          and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
          representatives
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Knowing my tendency to procrastinate until the very last possible
          moment, I am creating some mini goals for myself throughout the
          Sprints. I am trying to follow the timetable I've developed for
          myself, because once you get into a routine, things get so much easier
          and less stressful.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text reflection-prompt">
          What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
          you
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          If I'm starting to struggle with the mental load and my support system
          is not enough, I'll reach out to my facilitators or vent to a fellow
          student who I've made a connection with.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text reflection-prompt">
          A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          I expect the Facilitation team to have my back if I'm struggling both
          emotionally and academically. The bootcamp is going to be insanely
          difficult, so I really need all the help I can get.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text reflection-prompt">
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
          commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          As of now, I'm very fortunate to be able to fully devote my time to
          studying. I will still try and schedule an occasional date night with my husband while he's supporting me on this
          journey.
