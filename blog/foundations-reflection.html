          What are the three new things you have learnt about yourself and your
          ego due to the core learning?
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          It may sound arrogant, but I feel like I know myself pretty well at
          this point in my life, so there wasn't necessarily a lot of
          self-discovery happening during Core. However, there were parts of my
          personality that I had to re-examine for this whole intense experience
          and it felt quite useful.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-text">
          Let's start with one of my not-so-appealing traits — I am very
          competitive. During the first couple of weeks it was really hard to
          let go of trying to gauge how everyone else was doing and just focus
          on myself. Naturally, I still struggle with that sometimes, but I am
          much more worried about my own technical ability at this point. Ego?
          What ego? Trying to cram all of this new information into my poor
          brain is very humbling. So, for now if someone is doing great, I draw
          inspiration and try to learn new tricks from them, if someone is
          having difficulties, I strive to help if I can.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-text">
          Once again I had to face my introversion, but I was deliberately
          trying to go out of my way to reach out and be more open. While I'm
          never going to be the life of the party, I've managed to make some
          connections with awesome like-minded people. And honestly, to me it
          seems as important as all of the technical knowledge I'm gaining.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-text">
          I really enjoyed helping (or at least trying to!) others with their
          issues. It's a very satisfying feeling when you get through a problem
          and it finally works, and you've shared a bit of knowledge with
          someone else. I can sometimes be a grumpy "have you ever heard of
          Google" kind of gal, so it does feel great when I overcome that.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-text reflection-prompt">
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Programming is very collaborative, and it's not this super-exclusive
          club that only a few chosen ones have access to, so you will meet a
          lot of new people. Everyone is going to have their own view of life,
          values and challenges you may have never even considered before. It's
          essential to treat your colleagues or peers with respect and empathy,
          regardless of your own views. It does feel weird to say it because
          it's what you do in every other aspect of your life. Be kind to
          others, don't be judgemental, expand your horizons and be self-aware.
          Reflect on your behaviour if you feel like you've been rude to
          someone, don't just shrug it off.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text reflection-prompt">
          What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          I was quite surprised by the looping exercise. We had to pair up and
          listen to the other person talk about an issue for 2 minutes straight
          without giving any verbal feedback (that's so difficult!). It felt
          very rewarding to just completely focus on the other person and
          actually listen to what they are saying. And same goes the other way,
          it felt great to be heard!
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text reflection-prompt">
          What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          I found the very first blog entry the most challenging. Talking about
          your identity, values and ethical decisions in your very first
          exercise? That seemed very overwhelming and it feels like I could've
          done better with this bit a few weeks in. On the other hand, it set
          the pace and depth for further self-reflection.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text reflection-prompt">
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          To teach us how to best learn a lot of new information quickly
          (something that will apply throughout our programming careers), how to
          take care of yourself during that process and how to collaborate and
          communicate with others.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text reflection-prompt">
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
          instead? Justify your answer.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          I don't think it was a waste of time, even though I usually took much
          longer than suggested timeboxes to work through my answers (and I'm
          doing it again right now). The Core part really complements the
          technical learning and helps rewire your brain and shift your
          attitude. When you employ some of the techniques in good faith, they
          really help to view inevitable frustration and pain of learning in a
          completely different light — you are just growing!
