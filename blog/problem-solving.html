        <h2 class="blog-header">Take a break if you're stuck</h2>
        <p class="blog-text">
          What do you imagine when you think of programming? Is it someone
          dressed a la Mr. Robot furiously typing away while staring at some
          random green numbers in a dark basement? Not even close!
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Most of the time you spend programming it's all about being stuck on a
          problem or a bug, or trying to think of a suitable solution. In fact,
          a lot of ideas will come to you when you least expect them â€” when you
          go for a run, when you have just shampooed your hair or when you have
          finally given up and tried to fall asleep. And that's exactly why one
          of the problem-solving methods is as simple as taking a break and
          stepping away from the issue at hand. Once you are refreshed, it may
          be so much easier to tackle a problem with a new approach.
        </p>
        <h2 class="blog-text">Just do it!</h2>
        <p class="blog-text">
          My first go-to method when getting stuck while programming (and it
          happens all day every day because I am only beginning to learn) is to
          just TRY something. I'd give my problem a quick Google with
          embarrassingly low level of understanding, try a quick fix and see if
          it works. 80% of the time it doesn't, so then I actually begin to
          carefully study the documentation or that Stack Overflow answer.
        </p>
        <h2 class="blog-header">Rubber ducky</h2>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Next on the list is the famous "rubber ducky" method. Yes, once you
          start explaining your problem to anyone, be it a family member or a
          stuffed animal, you are very likely to experience that Aha! moment.
          For example, I was really struggling with positioning the elements on
          my website with CSS (that's the technology behind the styling). As I
          got more and more frustrated and was about to tell my husband what I
          really think about people who invented any sort of computers or
          programming languages, I formed a quick explanation in my mind and
          understood what the bug was as I was standing up from my desk.
        </p>
        <h2 class="blog-header">Use your toolkit</h2>
        <p class="blog-text">
          The more technical side of problem solving is to always read what the
          errors are telling you, google the exact error and read up. Use the
          DevTools in your browser or any other debugging tool to run your
          program step by step and see what's causing the issues. Console.log()
          every variable that's causing you grief.
        </p>
        <h2 class="blog-header">Ask for help</h2>
        <p class="blog-text">
          I am still struggling with asking for help from my peers or tutors
          because it feels a bit like cheating. I enjoy getting to the answer on
          my own, but I understand that it's not always realistic in a
          professional environment. While you won't be able to bother your
          colleagues about every little issue you have, you also can't spend
          days being stuck on something without getting any assistance.
