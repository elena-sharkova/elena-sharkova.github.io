      <h2 class="blog-header">Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <p class="blog-text">
        Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to create neural pathways as we
        learn or adapt to new circumstances. Until recently, scientists
        believed that our brains stop changing as we grow older, and while
        neuroplasticity in children is more prominent, adults can still
        benefit from it. As we work on a skill or think about a new idea, our
        brains form new neural pathways that become stronger and stronger with
        repetition and eventually replace the old ones. Understanding that
        intelligence and ability are malleable can lead to higher academic
        achievements and even help when recovering from a brain injury.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">
        Some of the more obvious ways to increase neuroplasticity are
        repetition, routine and practice. Moreover, having a clear idea on how
        our newfound knowledge is applicable not just in theory but also in
        real life is quite beneficial. Readjusting our approach with
        neuroplasticity in mind when encountering difficult tasks can
        drastically improve the results.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">
        I would love to employ the principles of neuroplasticity in my own
        life, especially when attending Dev Academy's bootcamp. I am
        practicing coding every day and it is quite comforting to think that
        my brain is working very hard to readjust to all this new knowledge. I
        was very surprised when I learned that "virtual" training or just
        thinking about an activity uses the same parts of the brain
        responsible for actually performing it.

      <h2 class="blog-header">Growth Mindset</h2>
      <p class="blog-text">
        The idea of growth vs fixed mindset has been developed and popularised
        by Carol Dweck, a psychology professor at Stanford University. The
        concept of a "fixed mindset" revolves around static intelligence and
        innate talent or ability. People with fixed mindset tend to avoid
        challenge, seek praise for their current achievements and fear making
        mistakes or being seen as unintelligent. On the other hand, people
        with "growth mindset" believe that with effort everyone can improve
        their intelligence and skills, while embracing challenges as a chance
        to learn more.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">
        While the theory draws some critique, especially when applied in
        academia, it could be very beneficial on an individual level. I am
        consciously trying to shift my mindset away from some of my fixed
        traits. I do tend to blame myself for being a failure when engaging
        with something beyond my current ability and that often makes me quit,
        but I am embracing the "it's an opportunity for growth" point of view.

      <h2 class="blog-header">Learning plan and strategies</h2>
      <p class="blog-text">
        While it is quite difficult to change your ways as an adult, I hope
        that understanding the science behind our brains can help me form new
        habits/ways of thinking and stay persistent. Neuroscience has always
        been a bit of a hobby for me, so reading up on topics like these helps
        me to get through the harder bits of learning.
