      <p class="reflection-prompt">
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">
        The hardest ethical decision I have ever had to make was leaving Russia
        and moving to New Zealand. My husband and I used to take part in the
        protests trying to fight for free elections, but after the annexation of
        Crimea we just gave up. 85% of the country supported this horrifying act
        of aggression that was the biggest step leading to the present war. We
        felt helpless and silenced. We had to weigh our hope for a brighter
        future for us and our hypothetical children against our love for our
        families that would stay behind. I am still not sure if it was the right
        decision because we paid for it dearly, but our parents always supported
        us and wanted us to have a safe life outside of Russia. There is also an
        implication that you are choosing your own freedom and comfort over
        staying and trying to dismantle the system and promote change.
      </p>
      <p class="reflection-prompt">
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">
        My parents have definitely shaped my values and identity. While many of
        the values we shared were very important, for example compassion,
        humour, risk-taking and lifelong desire to try new things, one trumps
        them all. It's this innate appreciation for freedom. Freedom in general,
        freedom of speech (my parents were journalists), freedom of choice...
        That appreciation was not reflected in the society I lived in. Whether I
        like it or not, I was still brought up on Russian culture, literature
        and art. I am Russian. To say that I'm having an identity crisis now
        that my homeland invaded Ukraine would be an understatement. I would
        very much rather identify as a kiwi, but I don't feel like I belong here
        yet although I finally think of Christchurch as home.

      <p class="reflection-prompt">
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">
        I believe that my biggest strengths are my curiosity and a somewhat
        creative side. I love learning new stuff, so it organically keeps me
        excited throughout my journey. I try to be open to different ideas and
        point of views, and I'm not afraid to change my beliefs. I also value
        humour and try a lighter approach when dealing with interpersonal drama.
      </p>
      <p class="reflection-prompt">
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">
        I am naturally very introverted and reserved and it takes a while for me
        to reveal my true sarcastic self to others. I may come off as arrogant
        or clinically shy until I work through my initial anxiety. I am trying
        to consciously go out of my way to be more social and connect with
        people during this experience because we just don't have any time for
        wallowing. Secondly, I am a bit of a lone wolf. I'm used to working on
        my own and working quickly — I've been a solo freelancer since I was 17
        with only a year-long stint in an office (big yikes, not a fan). So the
        prospect of team assignments, pair programming and being patient with
        others scares the living crap out of me.
      </p>
      <p class="reflection-prompt">
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">
        The latest example of some resistance when working/studying together was
        during my intro to programming class at Ara, but it was mainly due to
        the fact that I couldn't connect to what I perceived as a "boys' club".
        Reflecting back, it wasn't my gender, but my age and, to be totally
        transparent, lack of enthusiasm, that stopped me from finding common
        ground with young people straight out of school. I didn't use any real
        strategies and just carried on, but looking forward I believe I should
        be more vocal about my ideas and try to be more engaging with my peers —
        there's always some common interests, passions or experiences that can
        bring us closer. No need for me to sulk in the corner.
