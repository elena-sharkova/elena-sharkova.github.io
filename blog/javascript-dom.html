        JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS... for humans
      </h2>
      <p class="blog-text">
        When creating websites, we're using three major components: HTML (a markup language), CSS (a styling language),
        and an
        actual programming language, JavaScript. One way to describe the relationship between this iconic trio is to
        compare
        it to the human body.
      <p class="blog-text">HTML is responsible for the overall structure and content of a website. It provides our

        "body" with all of the bones, working organs and limbs. For now, the body is alive but not yet moving or
        speaking.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">CSS makes the websites pretty and positions elements according to the designer's preference.
        This
        is similar to choosing suitable clothes, a certain colour of nail polish and adding a pair of earrings. </p>
      <p class="blog-text">Finally, JavaScript makes the page interactive and brigs them to life. In terms of the body
        analogy, JavaScript provides us with functionality â€“ at this point we can communicate and move. </p>
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text"><span>BONUS:</span> I was having too much fun during Sprint 2 and came up with a <a href="../blog/screenplay.html"> <span class="underline-span">screenplay</span>
        </a> when describing the intense relationship between HTML and CSS. Hope you enjoy it!</p>

          Control flow and loops... for alien life forms

      <p class="blog-text">
        Control flow is how a program is executed, and normally it reads top to bottom. Imagine any everyday action you
        don't
        think twice about â€” going to the store, picking out an outfit for the day, walking your dog. If you had to
        explain
        this process to a friendly alien, you would pause and then, hopefully, come up with a set of step-by-step
        detailed
        instructions. Here's some "code" to help our imaginary friend make a nice cuppa:
      </p>


      <pre>
              <code>
function makeTea() {
      openKettle()
      pourWaterInKettle()
      closeKettle()
      turnKettleOn()
      waitForBoiling()
      getCup()
      pourWaterInCup()
      getTeabag()
      swirlTeabagInCup()
      takeTeabagOutOfCup()
      ???
      PROFIT
  } 
          </code>
          </pre>





      <p class="blog-text">
        Well, that's fine, but there are so many situations in our day to day lives when we repeat something unless
        something else happens. That's when loops come in. Examples? Your local supermarket has been recently renovated,
        and all of your favourite foods are now in all the wrong places! Take a look at this pretend while loop:
      </p>
      <pre>
      <code>
 while (cripsInMyBasket = 0) {
    keepRunningAroundSupermarket()
    hangry = True
  }        
      </code>

        What is DOM? Oh baby, don't hurt me! Don't hurt me... no more!
      </h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/html_dom.png" alt="a hand-drawn illustration of the DOM tree">
        <figcaption>An example of the DOM tree</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p class="blog-text">
        DOM or the Document Object Model is thoughtfully created by the browser when a website is opened. It creates a
        tree-like structure that JavaScript uses in order to communicate with HTML and try to interact with its
        elements.

      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">

        DOM is just like a family tree with a few differences. Tragically, each element (or a node) only has one parent,
        but don't feel sorry for this family â€” children have numerous siblings and behave amazingly well and always do
        exactly as told by their parent! And let's just say that parents are very, very prolific. They can have as many
        children as they wish and looks like there's no birth control in the HTML kingdom.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">
        <span>NB:</span> the root element (document) has no parent. ðŸ˜¢
      </p>
      <p class="blog-text">Below is an example of interacting with the DOM where we assign a variable to the HTML
        element with an id of "main".</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
let mainElement = document.getElementById("main");
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p class="blog-text"></p>

        Difference between accessing data from arrays and objects
      </h2>
      <p class="blog-text">
        An object is basically a thing. Any thing. This thing can have multiple characteristics:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
let student = {
    name: 'Elena',
    age: 35,
    enjoysWritingBlogs: false,
}

        </code>
      </pre>
      <p class="blog-text">
        To get ahold of the data stored in the object we use the dot notation.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
 student.name //returns "Elena"         
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p class="blog-text">
        An array is a collection of elements.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
 let hobbies = ["hiking", "reading", "playing WoW"]         
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p class="blog-text">
        To get ahold of data stored in an array we can use the indexation.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
hobbies[0] // returns "hiking"
        </code>
      </pre>
      <h2 class="blog-header">
        Functions. Why are we doing this to ourselves?
      </h2>
      <p class="blog-text">
        Functions are chunks of code that are created to perform a certain task. Whenever your code becomes repetitive,
        it might be a good idea to shove it into a brand new shiny function. What makes functions so hot? They are
        reusable and improve code readability (if you name them properly!).
